# CASTLE Documentation

### Introduction
The CASTLE framework consists of the CASL modeler, a code generator, an observation tool, and some visual feedback.
This documentation will help with all stages of using CASTLE, that is, using CASL, configuring and adding new metrics to the observation tool, and how to use the established code generator with Repast. Future versions will include a configurable code generator for other simulation targets.


The documentation is available to read online at [ReadTheDocs](http://castle-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

A PDF of the documentation is also available at [Link](http://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/castle-documentation/latest/castle-documentation.pdf) (Note: This gets updated automatically along with ReadTheDocs link)
