================

The Observation Tool takes data from the simulation and allows the user to run a variety of metrics and analysis tools on the data.
The Observation Tool allows metrics to run on data that is either being generated from a currently executing simulation, i.e. *live*, or from a previously executed and stored simulation i.e. *post-mortem*.
