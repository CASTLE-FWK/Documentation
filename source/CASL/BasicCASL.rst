===========

CASL supports common declarative language constructs such as ``if/else`` statments, loops, recursion, etc.

``IF/ELSE``
-----------
``IF`` statments in CASL are similar to C and Java based languages. An example is::

	if (condition) then
		//do something
	else if (another condition) then
		//do something else
	else
		//do something else
	endif;
